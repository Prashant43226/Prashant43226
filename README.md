- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m R.Prashant(@Prashant43226) currently a 4th year undergrad pursuing my B.Tech degree in Electronics and Communication engineering from Delhi Technological University.
- ðŸ‘€ My interests lie majorly in the fields of software development with majority of my projects revolving around Machine Learning and algorithms.The field of algorithms definitely attract me a lot 
and it has been shown as well in my projects and internships as well.

Lets have a look at my projects .
My projects have majorly revolved around building machine learning models or algorithms which have helped solve real world problems.

<br/>

A brief intro to my projects

<br/>

# A)Speech Enhancement Module using CR-CED and UNET

<br/>

â€¢ Implemented a Speech Enhancement module using CR-CED
and UNet Neural Networks to remove noise in Audio dataset.

<br/>

â€¢ The noisy and clear audio data was converted into STFT(Short
Time Fourier Transform) thus converting it into an image to
image recognition problem which was passed through an
autoencoder layer which consisted of a number of
convolutional layers with skip connections

<br/>

â€¢ Used STFT and a mix of CR-CED and UNet Neural Network
with 1,60,000 parameters trained using GPU with the help of
multiprocessing.

<br/>


â€¢ Trained the model to finally get a loss of just 0.1689 and rmse
value 0.4110

<br/>

#  B)IMPROVED ROUND ROBIN SCHEDULING ALGORITHM |

<br/>

Operating Systems for time shared devices 

<br/>

<a href="https://github.com/Prashant43226/Novel-Round-Robin-Scheduling-Algorithm">LINK</a>

<br/>

â€¢ This was a dynamic round robin scheduler which calculated
time quantum dynamically according to the burst time in the
waiting queue.

<br/>

â€¢ The dynamic round robin scheduler works better than round
robin scheduler by a factor of 10-20 percent.

<br/>

â€¢ Implemented on C++

<br/>

â€¢ It aims at reducing the context switches,waiting time and
response time between processes.
