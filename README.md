- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m R.Prashant(@Prashant43226) currently a 4th year undergrad pursuing my B.Tech degree in Electronics and Communication engineering from Delhi Technological University.
- ðŸ‘€ My interests lie majorly in the fields of software development with majority of my projects revolving around Machine Learning and algorithms.The field of algorithms definitely attract me a lot 
and it has been shown as well in my projects and internships as well.

Lets have a look at my projects .
My projects have majorly revolved around building machine learning models or algorithms which have helped solve real world problems.

<br/>

A brief intro to my projects

<br/>

# A)Speech Enhancement Module using CR-CED and UNET

<br/>

<br/>

<a href="https://github.com/Prashant43226/Speech-Enhancement-">LINK</a>

<br/>

â€¢ Implemented a Speech Enhancement module using CR-CED
and UNet Neural Networks to remove noise in Audio dataset.

<br/>

â€¢ The noisy and clear audio data was converted into STFT(Short
Time Fourier Transform) thus converting it into an image to
image recognition problem which was passed through an
autoencoder layer which consisted of a number of
convolutional layers with skip connections

<br/>

â€¢ Used STFT and a mix of CR-CED and UNet Neural Network
with 1,60,000 parameters trained using GPU with the help of
multiprocessing.

<br/>


â€¢ Trained the model to finally get a loss of just 0.1689 and rmse
value 0.4110

<br/>

#  B)IMPROVED ROUND ROBIN SCHEDULING ALGORITHM |

<br/>

Operating Systems for time shared devices 

<br/>

<a href="https://github.com/Prashant43226/Novel-Round-Robin-Scheduling-Algorithm">LINK</a>

<br/>

â€¢ This was a dynamic round robin scheduler which calculated
time quantum dynamically according to the burst time in the
waiting queue.

<br/>

â€¢ The dynamic round robin scheduler works better than round
robin scheduler by a factor of 10-20 percent.

<br/>

â€¢ Implemented on C++

<br/>

â€¢ It aims at reducing the context switches,waiting time and
response time between processes.

<br/>

# C)ROBOTICS SOFTWARE INTERNSHIP PROJECT

<br/>

<a href="https://github.com/Prashant43226/Robotics-Software-Internship">LINK</a>


<br/>

â€¢ Implemented complete scheduling of a m-robot n pickup drop
Travelling Salesman Problem from scratch.

<br/>

â€¢ Used Held Karp algorithm along with optimizations to speed up the
computations by 10x and decrease the memory overheads by 100x.

<br/>

â€¢ Also took care of charging constraints,deadlines and hard constraints.

<br/>

â€¢ Used optimizations such as local search,tabu search and other
metaheuristics to figure out the most optimal schedule and path for m
robots

<br/>

# D)Career Launcher Machine Learning Internship

<br/>

<a href="https://github.com/Prashant43226/Machine-Learning-Project">LINK</a>

<br/>

â€¢ This internship dealt with analysis of stocks of few select companies
using machine learning models with the help of Python libraries

<br/>

â€¢ It helped me gain insight into the world of finance and gave crucial
insights into things like time series models,Monte Carlo
simulation,bollinger bands to analyse stock movement,using
correlation to analyse stocks of different companies and so on.

<br/>

# E)Xmeme( An Intro to Web Development)

# F)Verilog Projects

<br/>

<a href="https://github.com/Prashant43226/Verilog">LINK</a>

FIFO BUFFER | Digital Electronics 
<br/>

â€¢ The project consists of First In First Out buffer implementation
on Verilog

<br/>

â€¢ The projects done include Circular and Non circular FIFO
buffers.


# G)32 -BIT MIPS PROCESSOR | Computer Architecture |

<br/>

<a href="https://github.com/Prashant43226/MIPS-Processor">LINK</a>

<br/>

Verilog Code for a 32 bit pipelined MIPS(Microprocessor
without Interlocked Pipelined Stages) Processor.

<br/>

Includes 32 32-bit Data Memory locations and instruction
memory consisting of arithmetic, logical, branch, jump, and
memory-access instructions. Immediate arguments and
argument registers are hard-coded.

# H)LOW BATTERY INDICATOR CIRCUIT

<br/>

<a href="https://github.com/Prashant43226/Low-batttery-indicator-project">LINK</a>

<br/>

â€¢ Low Battery Indicator circuit virtual and physical testing and
simulation using LTSpice tools.

<br/>

â€¢ The main advantage of the proposed two transistor low battery
indicator circuit is its very low current consumption compared
to the IC counterparts which consume relatively higher
currents.

<br/>

â€¢ Another advantage of this circuit is itâ€™s ability to work even at
voltages around 1.5V which gives it a clear edge over the IC
based circuits
